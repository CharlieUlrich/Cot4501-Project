    "The ARMA model functioned by looking back at previous days' predicted values as well as the errors of those predictions, following the function below:\n",
    "yt = c + ϕ1 yt-1 + θ1 ϵt-1 ….+ϕt y0+θt ϵ0\n",
    "-yt is the predicted value\n",
    "-c is a chosen constant\n",

    "\n",
    "When generating a prediction for the current day which considers the predictions and errors of the n days preceding it, the time complexity is O(n) and the flop count is equal to 4n + 1. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code to apply this function was built recursively and functioned the following way:\n",
    "1. The solver function which acts as ARMA is called and the array of values, and starting index, 0, are passed in\n",
    "2. Next the function initializes the variable, prev, which will hold the previous prediction\n",
    "3. Next it checks the if statement which acts as the base case, and if the array has a size which is greater than 1, it calls itself again passing in an array with the first value cut off, and back being incremented by one\n",
    "4. This is repeated until the break case is hit, which means that y0 has been reached and it returns the remaining value in info, this is stored in prev\n",
    "5. Then it breaks out of the if statement and returns the ARMA function solved at the current index, i.e. if it has been recurred 5 times and there were 6 data points, it would be at the 5th index, and since the time data was stored backwards it was at the second point chronologically, and the weight function is applied correctly with the weight being (1/t) or (1/5). It also adds the previous value so the values add up\n",
    "6. Finally the value at the next time is returned, and the data is modeled. Afterwards, if a constant is needed it can be applied "

In general, a strictly decreasing exponential function of x is most appropriate for this, as any increasing function will place unwarranted interest on old data. However, possible use cases could exist in which a linear or constant function may be more appropriate.\n",

The following plot illustrates the true value of the aapl stock for the first 1000 days of data available alongside the value predicted by the ARIMA model. In this case, the ten preceding days' prices are considered when predicting the change for that day. A weighting function of 2/(e^x) is used to give weighting priority to the two days immediately preceding the day being examined. This results in a model which is highly reactive to sudden price changes and closely fits the true data. However, as is shown below, this also leads to a general overreaction in the case of sudden changes in price. The ramifications of this will be explored in more detail below."
